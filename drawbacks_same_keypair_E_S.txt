Is always bad to use the same keypairs for do encryption/decryption and for signing documents. This is true for many reasons,
first of all if Trudy in some ways retrieve an encrypted message $P_a\{M\}$ sent by Bob to Alice she then can pretend to be Bob
 (typical Alice-Bob comunication scenario) and send to Alice a request for signing a document C that is indeed the previous encrypted message.
 Now Alice dutyfully sign C with her private key and Trudy came up with the plaintext M. The same result (good one for Trudy ) can be reached
 both via the public key encryption of a nonce either via private signing of a plain nonce because of from Alice's point of view the procedure is
 the same. However this is a bad idea also for another reason : Key management .\\
 Signature keys and encryption keys have different lifetime in terms of backups, access control, repudiation, etc. The fallback for a signature key in
 case of a catastrophic event is to destroy it to avoid future forgeries, so a signature key does not need to be backed up extensively , and in case
 of leak pre-existing documents still remain valid and signed by the trustworthy person and just the new ones has to be withdrawed.\\
Conversely, the fallback for an encryption key is to keep it around to decrypt existing documents, so it needs to be backed up reliably, in case of a leak of an encryption key,
 the confidentiality of all pre-existing documents is at risk, whereas new documents simply need to be encrypted with a different key.
